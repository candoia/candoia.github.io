{"name":"Candoia","tagline":"A Platform and Ecosystem for Software Engineering Tools","body":"### Welcome to Candoia.\r\nCandoia is a platform for realizing Mining Software Repository (MSR) Tools, and more broadly software engineering tools. Candoia is to MSR tools as Android and iOS are to mobile applications, and Atom is to text editors. Like these platforms, Candoia provides suitable abstractions for building MSR tools and handles the details of integration with VCS, bug databases, language parsers, visualization, etc. A tool developer prototypes their idea as Candoia apps and can publish them. Practitioners install Candoia platform and can browse through available apps, download them, and if necessary customize them for their own needs.\r\n\r\n### More Information ...\r\nCandoia platform is being worked upon and you can expect more details, including download URLs here in few days.
